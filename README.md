Go to releases and download which ever version seems most interesting to you.

In 0.51 you can drive around but 0.52 has at least primitive suspension and steering for the car.

Download logo.ico, saab.html and style_saab.css and then open saab.html if you want to see the old changelog webpage. Warning: the page is very ugly. :D
